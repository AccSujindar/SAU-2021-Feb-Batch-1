== : comparing two operends by ignoring their data types.
=== : comparing two operends, but their data types is also considered.

Example: a) 5 == "5"   output: true
	 b) 5 === "5"  output: false

Why a) is true?

When doing comparison, string will be converted to a number. Empty string will be converted to zero,
and if it cannot be resolved to a number, it will converted to 'NAN'. In the example, "5" can be 
converted to number 5, hence it will return true.

why b) is false?

Here the === will take data types. since 5 is a number and "5" is a string, which are different,
it will return false;

Example: a) true == "true" output: false

Here the output is false because,true will converted to number which becomes 1, "true" will be 
converted to a number which becomes NAN, now 1 == NAN becomes false.
